Wine's own d3dx9_*.dll and d3dcompiler_*.dll may produce invalid shader
bytecode incompatible with D9VK. Install original implementations of
these DLLs from Microsoft to circumvent possible problems.

Original DLLs can be installed using winetricks. Correct version depends
on what particular application is trying to load. There is a way to
install all versions known to winetricks:

    winetricks d3dx9 $( winetricks dlls list | sed -rn "s,^(d3dcompiler_[0-9]+).*$,\1,p" )
